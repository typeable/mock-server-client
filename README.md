## About

The package is the client library for the [mock server](https://www.mock-server.com/). The source code is
generated by the [openapi3-code-generator](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/openapi3-code-generator), specifically its patched version.

## How to regenerate code from the spec

```
cd codegen && ./regen.sh
```

It requires the `nix` to be installed in your system because it uses the
`openapi3-code-generator` built by the `nix`.

After regeneration you will see some `.hs` files changed. This is because some
parts of the libary are modified by hand to make the more usable.

## Files

### The `codegen` dir

* `regen.sh` is the simple script to regenerate the whole package.
* `shell.nix` a shell in which the `regen.sh` calls the `openapi3-code-generator` to regenerate the
* `mock-server-openapi-5.13.x-swagger.yaml` not the original file as you might
  think. The thing is that the `openapi3-code-generator` does not support all
  the features of the OpenAPI3 standard correctly, so it is
  hand-postprocessed. It was originally downloaded from [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/jamesdbloom/mock-server-openapi/5.13.x) and fixed.
* `src` contails the generted code, but not exactly. Some of the parts of the
  generted code was not very pleasant, so it was fixed too.

### What will happen if you just call the `regen.sh`?

It will build the `openapi3-code-generator` in `nix` and regenerate the whole
Haskell source code. You will see that the code was changed, because as
mentioned earlier the original code was slightly modified, so watch your commits.

## How the to update the package to the new version of the `mock-server`?

* Commit all changes
* `git checkout update-openapi-spec`
* Replace the `codegen/mock-server-openapi.yaml` with a newer version
* `git commit -m "updated mock-server-openapi.yaml to version $NEWVERSION"`
* `git checkout -b "update-$NEWVERSION" master`
* `git merge update-openapi-spec`
* Resolve conflicts if any
* `./codegen/regen.sh`
* `git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/update-generated-code && git reset`
  switching to the branch `update-generated-code` without checking out the working-tree
* `git commit -m "update the generted code for version $NEWVERSION"`
* `git checkout "update-$NEWVERSION"`
* `git merge update-generated-code`
* Resolve conflicts if any
* `git push origin "update-$NEWVERSION"`
* Create PR, wait for CI, review, merge into the master
